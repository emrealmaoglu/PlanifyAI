The Integrated Campus: A Technical Guide to Implementing International Accessibility Standards and Quantitative Sustainability Metrics


Part 1: Foundations of the Universally Accessible and Sustainable Campus

The modern university campus is a microcosm of a city, comprising a complex web of residential, academic, commercial, and public spaces. Its planning demands a sophisticated integration of two parallel mandates: the ethical and legal imperative for universal accessibility, and the strategic, long-term goal of environmental and social sustainability. This report synthesizes these two domains, providing a technical framework for planners to move beyond simple compliance and implement a data-driven, quantifiable model of an integrated, inclusive, and resilient campus.

Section 1.1: The Guiding Philosophy: Universal Design Principles

Before any technical standard or legal code is consulted, campus planning must be grounded in a foundational philosophy. Universal Design (UD) provides this philosophy, shifting the objective from accommodating disabilities to including the full spectrum of human diversity by default.
Coined by the Center for Universal Design (CUD) at North Carolina State University, UD is defined as "the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design".1 For a postsecondary institution, this means creating educational products and environments that serve students and staff with a wide variety of characteristics from the outset.1
This approach is codified in seven guiding principles, which serve not as a prescriptive checklist, but as an evaluative framework to guide the design process.2
Table 1: The Seven Principles of Universal Design: Guidelines and Campus Applications

Principle
CUD Guideline
Campus Planning Application
1. Equitable Use
The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. (e.g., "Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.")
A main building entrance with a gentle, integrated slope used by all, rather than a "primary" staircase and a segregated ramp at the rear.
2. Flexibility in Use
The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. (e.g., "Accommodate right- or left-handed access.")
Lecture hall seating with integrated, movable desk surfaces suitable for both right- and left-handed users, with ample space for assistive devices.
3. Simple and Intuitive Use
Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience or knowledge. (e.g., "Eliminate unnecessary complexity.")
A clear, logical campus wayfinding system with consistent signage and building numbering that is easy to navigate for a first-time visitor.
4. Perceptible Information
The design communicates necessary information effectively, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
A campus alert system that combines visual (strobe lights), audible (alarms), and tactile (vibration) warnings. Digital maps with high-contrast modes.
5. Tolerance for Error
The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. (e.g., "Provide warnings of hazards and errors.")
Low-profile, high-contrast curb edges that minimize tripping hazards and are detectable by cane. Non-slip surfacing on all exterior paths.
6. Low Physical Effort
The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. (e.g., "Minimize repetitive actions.")
Automated door openers and levers (not knobs) for all primary doors. Sufficient, frequent rest areas along campus walking routes.
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.
Wide, clear corridors and turn-around spaces in all buildings.3 Laboratory benches and library desks with proper knee clearance for wheelchair users.
A critical distinction must be made: standards like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) represent a legal minimum for compliance, whereas UD represents the ethical maximum for true inclusivity. A campus can be 100% ADA-compliant yet fail at Universal Design. For example, a building entrance with a long, segregated ramp at the rear may meet ADA's technical specifications for slope and width, but it directly violates UD Principle 1, "Equitable Use," by segregating and stigmatizing users.3
Furthermore, the UD principles create a direct, causal link to the quantitative sustainability metrics detailed in Part 3 of this report. UD principles related to cognition and perception—such as "Simple and Intuitive Use" (Principle 3) and "Perceptible Information" (Principle 4)—are prerequisites for effective wayfinding. A campus that is simple to navigate reduces cognitive load and stress, which is a key component of "social wellbeing" as defined within sustainability frameworks like BREEAM Communities.4 This improved, low-stress pedestrian experience directly causes a higher quantitative score in metrics like the EPA Walkability Index, which rewards well-connected and easy-to-navigate environments.6 Thus, a successful UD implementation is a direct, quantifiable driver of sustainability.

Section 1.2: Frameworks for Holistic Assessment: LEED and BREEAM

While UD provides the philosophy, campus-scale sustainability frameworks provide the holistic system for measuring and certifying performance. Standard green building tools are insufficient as they focus on individual structures. A campus is a community. Therefore, the appropriate frameworks are those designed for neighborhood-scale development.
LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND)
The U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) LEED-ND framework is explicitly designed to extend green principles "beyond the footprint of a structure and into the broader community it serves".7 This makes it an ideal tool for campus master planning. Its major credit categories organize the key goals of sustainable campus design 8:
Smart Location and Linkage (SLL): This category provides guidance on where to build, encouraging development on sites with existing infrastructure, services, and public transit.10 For a campus, this guides the placement of new residence halls or academic buildings to maximize access to existing transit hubs and community amenities.
Neighborhood Pattern and Design (NPD): This category guides what to build. It promotes "compact, complete, connected, and convivial" environments.10 A "complete" campus is one that is mixed-use, with residential, academic, and retail/service uses in close proximity. The quantitative metrics for walkability (Section 3.2), connectivity (Section 3.4), and mixed-use (Section 3.3) are the primary tools for measuring success in the NPD category.
Green Infrastructure and Buildings (GIB): This category guides how to build, focusing on high-performance buildings and sustainable management of the landscape, such as stormwater and habitat.8
BREEAM Communities
Developed by the UK's Building Research Establishment (BRE), BREEAM Communities is the equivalent framework for masterplans and community-scale interventions.4 It provides a method for evaluating the "environmental, social, and economic performance" of a large-scale development.11
This framework provides the explicit conceptual link between this report's two main topics: accessibility and sustainability. BREEAM Communities explicitly includes categories for "health and wellbeing" 4 and social wellbeing.5 An accessible campus—one that meets not just the physical requirements of ADA but also the functional, sensory-focused requirements of standards like EN 17210 (e.g., good acoustics, low-stress wayfinding) 13—is a prerequisite for achieving social wellbeing.
This strategically reframes accessibility. Investment in deep, universal accessibility is no longer just a legal cost or a compliance burden; it is a quantifiable sustainability gain that contributes directly to a high BGOOD or BREEAM Communities certification score, enhancing the institution's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) profile. While some BREEAM versions are UK-specific, "BREEAM Communities Bespoke International" exists to adapt the tool to any local context.15

Section 1.3: Global Benchmarks: UN Sustainable Development Goal 11

At the highest strategic level, campus planning can be aligned with globally-recognized benchmarks, providing a powerful justification for investment to university leadership and external stakeholders. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11, "Sustainable Cities and Communities," provides the two most relevant indicators.
SDG Indicator 11.3.1 (Land Use Efficiency): This metric is defined as the "ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate" (LCR).16 It is the primary global indicator for urban compactness. A campus that adds students and staff (population growth) without proportionally expanding its physical footprint (land consumption) will achieve a high score on this metric.
SDG Indicator 11.7.1 (Access to Public Space): This metric is defined as the "average share of the built-up area... that is open space for public use".18 This indicator, calculated using GIS 20, measures the availability of green and public spaces, such as quads, parks, and plazas, for all.
At first glance, these two indicators appear to be in direct conflict. To achieve Indicator 11.3.1, a planner must build densely and consume less land. To achieve 11.7.1, a planner must preserve land for open space and build less.
This apparent contradiction reveals the necessity of a sophisticated, three-dimensional planning approach. The only way to satisfy both goals simultaneously is through vertical density. By increasing the Floor Area Ratio (FAR)—a key compactness metric defined as the total building floor area divided by the parcel land area 22—the campus can add significant interior floorspace (accommodating population growth and satisfying 11.3.1) while minimizing the building's ground-level footprint. This strategy liberates valuable ground-level land to be dedicated to high-quality, accessible public green space, thereby satisfying Indicator 11.7.1. These metrics, detailed in Part 3, provide the technical levers to manage this strategic trade-off.

Part 2: Technical Specifications for International Accessibility Compliance

This section details the non-negotiable legal and technical standards that form the baseline for any campus plan. These standards are categorized into prescriptive (what to build), functional (how it should work), and local (how to synthesize).

Section 2.1: Prescriptive Standards: ADAAG (United States)

The U.S. Department of Justice's Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) are the benchmark for prescriptive standards. They provide precise, quantitative rules. For campus planning, the most critical section is Chapter 4: Accessible Routes.24
The core concept of ADAAG is that accessibility is not just about buildings, but about the network that connects them.26 A campus can have 100% compliant buildings but be systemically inaccessible if the routes between them are non-compliant.
Key technical specifications for these routes include:
Path/Walking Surface Slopes: The running slope of a walking surface must not be steeper than 1:20, or 5.0%.24 Any path steeper than this must be treated as a ramp.
Ramp Slopes & Rise: The maximum running slope for a ramp is 1:12 (8.33%). The maximum vertical rise for any single ramp run is 30 inches (760 mm), after which a level landing must be provided.26
Clear Width: The minimum continuous clear width for an accessible route is 36 inches (915 mm).24 This can be reduced to 32 inches (815 mm) at a single point (such as a doorway) for a maximum depth of 24 inches.27
Ground and Floor Surfaces: Per ADAAG Section 302, all ground and floor surfaces on an accessible route must be "firm, stable, and slip-resistant".28
Table 2: ADAAG Technical Specifications for Accessible Routes (Paths, Ramps, and Landings)

These prescriptive rules are not just a compliance checklist. In a modern data-driven workflow, they become the input parameters for the quantitative models in Part 3. A truly inclusive campus plan must perform its network analysis (for walkability and access) twice:
General Population Model: Using the full pedestrian network, including stairs.
Accessible Network Model: Using a filtered network where all paths with slopes $> 5.0\%$ 24, non-compliant ramps, and paths with widths $< 36$ inches 27 are removed.
The discrepancy between the results of these two models (e.g., a high "general" access score but a low "accessible" access score) becomes the single most powerful diagnostic tool for identifying and rectifying systemic inequity.

Section 2.2: Functional Requirements: EN 17210:2021 (Europe)

The European standard EN 17210:2021: "Accessibility and usability of the built environment – Functional requirements" 29 represents a fundamentally different, and complementary, approach. It moves beyond prescriptive physical rules to establish functional outcomes, supporting the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.31
This standard is critical for campus planning because it expands the definition of "accessibility" from physical mobility to include sensory and cognitive accessibility.32 A campus is a learning environment, and learning can be impaired by sensory or cognitive barriers.
Key functional requirements of EN 17210 include:
Wayfinding, Orientation, and Navigation: The built environment "shall be designed... to facilitate wayfinding".13 This requires more than just signs; it includes "good lighting conditions," "differences in acoustics, surface material, light and colour" 13, and providing information in multiple formats (visual, tactile/braille, audible).33
Sensory Environment: The standard mandates consideration of the full sensory experience. This includes "acoustics, lighting, noise, temperature and air quality".14 This is particularly impactful for users with sensory hypersensitivity, such as neurodivergent individuals, for whom harsh lighting or poor acoustics can render a space unusable.14
The challenge of a functional standard is measurement. How does a planner prove the environment "facilitates wayfinding"? The solution lies in synthesizing Part 1 and Part 2: the Universal Design Principles (Section 1.1) provide the implementation and evaluation framework for EN 17210's functional goals.
For example, to meet the functional goal of "facilitating wayfinding" 13, the planner can implement UD Principle 4: "Perceptible Information." This is achieved by following its specific guidelines, such as "Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information".3 Thus, the UD Principles (the "how") become the technical guide for achieving EN 17210's goals (the "what").

Section 2.3: Comparative Analysis and Local Implementation (Turkish Standards)

Most jurisdictions require planners to synthesize international, national, and local standards. The provided Turkish standards serve as an excellent case study.
National Standards (TSE): The Turkish Standards Institute (TSE) provides the primary national codes. The key standards mirror the common split between buildings and public space:
TS 9111: "Rules for the Regulation of Buildings for Disabled People".34
TS 12576: "Urban Roads - Design Rules for Structural Measures... for Disabled and Elderly".34
Local Standards (İBB): Local municipalities, such as the İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB), provide an additional layer of technical specifications.34 These are often more detailed, such as the İBB requirement for 80 cm wide tactile "following strips" on wide sidewalks, flanked by 80 cm of clear space on either side.35
A private university campus is a hybrid space—it is not a single building (TS 9111) nor a public road (TS 12576). As such, planners must synthesize these standards. Research on Turkish public parks, for example, uses both TS 9111 and TS 12576 to evaluate the accessibility of "in-park road routes" and "landscape equipment".36 The correct, defensible planning methodology is to create a unified campus standard that adopts the strictest applicable rule from all relevant standards (e.g., ADAAG, EN 17210, TS 9111, TS 12576, and İBB regulations).

Part 3: Implementation Guide: Quantitative Metrics for Campus Analysis

This part provides the computational core of the report: the mathematical formulations and implementation algorithms for the key sustainability metrics.

Section 3.1: Measuring Spatial Access: The 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) Method

To move beyond simple proximity ("is there a library near this dorm?") and measure true access, planners must account for congestion. The 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method is the industry-standard model for this.
The 2SFCA model provides the quantitative expression of Universal Design Principle 1: "Equitable Use".3 It allows a planner to map "access deserts" and "access oases" by calculating an access score for every demand point (e.g., dorm) based on the capacity of, and competition for, nearby resources (e.g., library seats, study spaces, health center appointments).
Mathematical Formulation
The calculation is performed in two steps within a given travel time threshold $T$ (e.g., a 10-minute accessible walk) 37:
Step 1: Supply-to-Demand Ratio ($R_j$). For each supply point $j$ (e.g., a library), calculate its ratio of supply (capacity $S_j$) to the total demand $D_i$ from all demand points $i$ that can reach it within the threshold $T$.$$R_j = \frac{S_j}{\sum_i D_i I(t_{ij} < T)}$$(where $I(t_{ij} < T)$ is 1 if travel time $t_{ij}$ is less than threshold $T$, and 0 otherwise)
Step 2: Access Score ($A_i$). For each demand point $i$ (e.g., a dorm), sum the ratios $R_j$ of all supply points $j$ that it can reach within the threshold $T$.$$A^{2sfca}_i = \sum_j R_j I(t_{ij} < T)$$
Implementation
This model is implemented in Python using the pysal/access package, which is part of the Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL) ecosystem and integrates with geopandas.37
The methodology must be calibrated using the Accessible Network Model from Part 2. Using a standard 5-minute walk for $T$ is discriminatory. The correct, inclusive methodology is:
Create the ADA-compliant pedestrian network (filtered for slopes $< 5.0\%$, widths $> 36$ inches, no stairs).24
Calculate the travel time matrix ($t_{ij}$) on this filtered network using a documented "accessible" walking speed.
Use this matrix as the input for the 2SFCA algorithm.
This ADA-Calibrated 2SFCA Model provides a true, defensible measure of inclusive spatial access.

Section 3.2: Quantifying Walkability: The EPA National Walkability Index (NWI)

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Walkability Index (NWI) provides a replicable methodology for assessing campus walkability. It is built from four variables found in the EPA's Smart Location Database (SLD).6
Methodology and Formula
The NWI ranks all U.S. block groups into 20 quantiles (a score of 1 to 20) for each of the four variables. It then applies a weighted average 6:
NWI Score = ($1/3$ $\times$ Rank_D3b) + ($1/3$ $\times$ Rank_D4a) + ($1/6$ $\times$ Rank_D2b) + ($1/6$ $\times$ Rank_D2a)
The NWI's reliance on quantiles makes it a relative index. A score of 20 means "in the top 5% of the US," not "perfect walkability".6 A dense campus may have all its areas score 20, making the index less useful for internal comparison.
For this reason, planners should deconstruct the NWI, using its raw variables (e.g., intersections per square km) for internal comparison. For international or localized use where SLD data is unavailable, a powerful proxy index can be created using open data:
Intersection Density (1/3 weight): Calculated from OpenStreetMap data using the OSMnx package (see Section 3.4).
Transit Proximity (1/3 weight): Calculated using local GTFS data or digitized campus shuttle stops.
Land Use Mix (1/3 weight): Calculated using the Entropy Index (see Section 3.3).
This NWI_Campus proxy is computationally feasible, internationally applicable, and true to the NWI's intent.

Section 3.3: Assessing Land Use Diversity: The Mixed-Use Entropy Index

A walkable, "complete" campus (as per LEED-ND's NPD goal 10) requires a fine-grained mix of uses. The Shannon's Entropy Index is the standard metric for quantifying this diversity.40
Formula and Algorithm
The formula calculates the diversity of $k$ land use types (e.g., $k=4$: academic, residential, commercial, open space) within a given area (e.g., a 100m grid cell) 40:

$$\text{Entropy Index} = - \sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{P_j \times \ln(P_j)}{\ln(k)}$$
Where $P_j$ is the percentage of area for each land use $j$. The score ranges from 0 (a single use) to 1 (a perfectly balanced mix of all $k$ uses).
Calculation requires two core GIS geoprocessing steps, which are automated by packages like the Python landusemix library 41:
Intersect: The campus land use polygons are intersected with the analysis grid.
Dissolve: The resulting polygons are dissolved by their grid ID and land use code to sum the area of each use type $j$ within each grid cell. This sum is used to calculate $P_j$.40
This metric is the quantitative engine for LEED-ND. A planner can set a target (e.g., "All campus precincts must achieve an Entropy Index $\geq 0.75$") and use this metric to prove their design creates a "complete" and vibrant neighborhood.10

Section 3.4: Modeling Network Connectivity: Graph-Based Indices

Before a campus can be walkable (NWI) or accessible (2SFCA), its underlying path network must be structurally sound. Graph theory, pioneered in transportation by Kansky (1963), provides the tools to measure this.42 The network is abstracted to edges $e$ (paths) and vertices $v$ (intersections).44
Beta Index ($\beta$): $\beta = e / v$. This measures the edge-to-vertex ratio, or intersection density.45 A $\beta$ score $< 1.0$ indicates a sparse, tree-like structure with many dead ends. A $\beta$ score $> 1.5$ indicates a well-connected grid.
Gamma Index ($\gamma$): $\gamma = e / (3(v - 2))$. This measures completeness, comparing the actual number of edges $e$ to the maximum possible edges in a planar graph.43 A score of 1.0 is a perfectly connected network; a score near 0 is a fragmented one.
Alpha Index ($\alpha$): $\alpha = (e - v + 1) / (2v - 5)$. This measures circuity and redundancy.43 A score of 0 represents a simple tree with no path choices. A high $\alpha$ indicates a resilient grid with multiple routes, which reduces travel time and improves wayfinding.
Table 5: Kansky's Connectivity Indices: Formulas and Interpretation

$> 0.6$ (High)
Alpha ($\alpha$)
$(e - v + 1) / (2v - 5)$
Circuity / Redundancy (0 to 1). Higher is more resilient.
$> 0.2$ (High)
These indices are implemented using the Python OSMnx package, which can extract campus street and path networks directly from OpenStreetMap.46
The most powerful application of these indices is in synthesizing Part 2 and Part 3 to identify the "Accessibility Connectivity Gap." The planner must run this analysis twice:
General Network: Calculate $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ on the full pedestrian network (including stairs).
Accessible Network: Calculate $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ on the ADA-filtered network (stairs and steep paths removed).
A campus might have a high general $\beta$ score (e.g., 1.6) but a filtered $\beta$ score of 0.9. This discrepancy is a profound, defensible finding: it proves that the campus is a highly-connected grid for the able-bodied but a fragmented, tree-like structure for wheelchair users.

Section 3.5: Evaluating Spatial Configuration: Compactness and Green Space

Finally, these metrics evaluate the high-level spatial configuration that aligns with the SDG 11 goals from Section 1.3.
Compactness Metrics: These are Population Density (inhabitants/ha) 47 and Floor Area Ratio (FAR).22 These metrics quantify the 3D density required to meet SDG 11.3.1 (Land Use Efficiency).
Green Space Metric: The primary metric is Green Space Per Capita (Total area of public green space / Total population).49
Benchmark Value: The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a key international benchmark, recommending a minimum of 9 m² of green space per capita.52
These metrics are the levers a planner pulls to resolve the strategic tension between SDG 11.3.1 (compactness) and 11.7.1 (green space). By modeling scenarios, a planner can demonstrate that increasing the FAR in a new development precinct allows the campus to meet its population goals while simultaneously liberating land to exceed the WHO's 9 m²/capita benchmark.
However, the Green Space Per Capita metric alone is flawed. As case studies show, a city can meet the WHO recommendation but have most of its space be inaccessible.53 This highlights the necessity of a synthetic model. The true measure of success is not quantity of green space, but accessible quantity, which is calculated by running the 2SFCA model (Section 3.1) using green space area (m²) as the "supply" ($S_j$).

Part 4: Data, Visualization, and Strategic Synthesis

This final part provides the practical guidance for implementing the models from Part 3 and unifies the entire report into a single, cohesive workflow.

Section 4.1: Validation Datasets and Benchmarking

Implementing this framework requires a unified data repository. Data collection is often the primary barrier, but a clear strategy simplifies the process.
Network Data: The base network (paths, sidewalks, roads) can be downloaded from OpenStreetMap using the OSMnx package.46 This must be augmented with campus-specific GIS data (or manual field surveys) to add the critical attributes for slope, width, and stair locations. This creates the filterable network required for the "Accessible Network Model."
Areal Units & Land Use: Authoritative GIS layers for parcels, building footprints, and land use/zoning codes should be sourced from municipal open data portals (e.g., NYC Open Data 57 or local/state clearinghouses 57). If land use data is unavailable, it can be created by classifying building footprints by function (academic, residential, etc.).
Demand Points: This layer is created from campus data. It should consist of building entrances (e.g., dorms, academic buildings) with a 'population' attribute (e.g., number of residents, number of faculty/staff offices).
Supply Points: This is a custom-built point layer of all campus amenities (e.g., libraries, cafes, study hubs, health centers, green space entrances) with a 'capacity' attribute (e.g., number of seats, m² of area, number of appointments).
This core set of geopandas GeoDataFrames becomes the "single source of truth" that feeds all the quantitative models in Part 3.

Section 4.2: Visualization Strategies for Planning and Communication

A complex analysis is useless if it cannot be communicated. The choice of visualization must match the metric and the audience. The primary Python libraries for this are geopandas, matplotlib, and OSMnx.60
For Access (2SFCA) and Quality (NWI, Entropy): Use a Choropleth Map. This is the standard for visualizing data aggregated to discrete areas (like a grid cell or campus precinct).61 It clearly shows "hotspots" and "deserts," guiding investment decisions.
For Connectivity (Kansky): Use a Network Graph Diagram. Plotting the Accessible Network (filtered) on top of the General Network (full) in different colors (e.g., accessible paths in green, non-accessible in red) visually displays the "Accessibility Connectivity Gap."
For Benchmarks (Green Space Per Capita): Use a simple Bar Chart (matplotlib.pyplot.bar()) to compare the campus's score against the WHO 9 m² benchmark.52

Section 4.3: A Unified Model for Integrated Campus Planning

The final deliverable of this report is not a set of disparate metrics, but a single, multi-level analytic workflow. This model connects ground-level compliance (ADA) to high-level strategy (SDGs), allowing a planner to justify every decision with quantitative, defensible data.
The 5-Level Integrated Planning Model:
Level 0: Compliance (The Baseline Filter)
Action: Audit the physical pedestrian network against the technical specifications of ADAAG (slopes, widths) 24, EN 17210 (sensory inputs, wayfinding) 13, and local standards (e.g., TS 9111/12576).34
Output: The "Accessible Network" filter—a binary classification of every path on campus.
Level 1: Structure (The Bones)
Action: Analyze the filtered and unfiltered networks using Kansky's Connectivity Indices (Section 3.4).
Output: The "Accessibility Connectivity Gap." This quantifies systemic inequity in the network's fundamental design.
Level 2: Opportunity (The Arteries)
Action: Run the ADA-Calibrated 2SFCA model (Section 3.1) on the filtered network to model access to amenities (libraries, cafes, green space).
Output: An equitable access map. This quantifies Universal Design's "Equitable Use" 3 and identifies "access deserts" for priority investment.
Level 3: Quality (The Environment)
Action: Calculate the precinct-level scores for the Localized NWI (Section 3.2), Entropy Index (Section 3.3), and Green Space Per Capita (Section 3.5).
Output: A dashboard of environmental quality. This measures the vibrancy and quality of the places that the Level 1/2 network provides access to.
Level 4: Strategy (The Justification)
Action: Roll all metrics from Levels 1-3 up to demonstrate progress toward the holistic goals of LEED-ND (e.g., "NPD" credits) 10 and BREEAM Communities (e.g., "Social Wellbeing").4
Output: A strategic report for leadership, justifying the campus plan's contribution to the university's high-level commitment to UN SDG 11.16
This unified model transforms the planning process from a subjective art into a data-driven science. It creates a defensible, causal chain from the slope of a single curb ramp to the institution's highest strategic goals, ensuring the creation of a campus that is truly, and quantifiably, accessible, sustainable, and inclusive for all.
